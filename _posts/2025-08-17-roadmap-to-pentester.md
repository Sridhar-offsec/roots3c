# 🚀 My Roadmap to Becoming a Pentester  

Hi, I’m **Sridhar**.  

I’ve been working in IT for some years now, and back in 2021 I cleared my **CEH Practical**. At that time, I thought I was on track, but honestly, I didn’t push myself enough. Recently, something clicked — I decided I want to get serious and chase my real goal:  
👉 Becoming a **Penetration Tester**.

## 🌟 How It All Started  
Like many people in security, my motivation started in an unusual way. I watched the **Mr. Robot series** 🎭, and it left a mark on me. The way Elliot used hacking — not just for fun, but with purpose — showed me how powerful this field can be. That series made me think: *“Why can’t I do this in real life?”*

## 📚 Where I Am Today  
- I have an IT admin background.  
- I work with tools like **ManageEngine** and **Cortex XDR**.  
- I’m **CEH Practical certified**.  

That’s my base. But I know it’s just the starting point. There’s a lot more I need to learn — networking in depth, Linux mastery, web vulnerabilities, scripting, and real-world pentesting skills.

## 🛤️ My Plan Ahead  
I don’t want to keep everything in my head and forget it later. So, I’ll use this blog as my open notebook. Here’s what I’ll be focusing on step by step:  

1. Get stronger in **basics** → Networking, Linux, scripting.  
2. Learn **attack techniques** → web, passwords, exploits.  
3. Practice daily → picoCTF, HackTheBox, TryHackMe.  
4. Share **everything I learn here** → notes, tools, CTF writeups.  
5. Aim for the **eJPT cert**, then move further.

## ✍️ What You’ll See in This Blog  
- Notes from my study sessions.  
- CTF writeups (step by step).  
- Tool guides in my own words.  
- Projects/scripts I build along the way.  

This is going to be a mix of raw notes and proper writeups — nothing fancy, just real learning in progress.

## 🎯 Final Words  
I’m starting this blog to keep myself accountable and to share what I learn.  
If you’re on the same journey, maybe some of my notes will help you too.  

Let’s hack, learn, and grow 🚀
